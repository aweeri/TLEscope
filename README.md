### TLEscope

TLEscope helps you visualize satellite data using Two-Line Element (TLE) sets. It allows for previewing current, and future positions of orbital bodies in a visually appealing 3D/2D space, allowing you to see their line-of-sight coverage areas, orbital characteristics, and more.

### OS Support
Currently Linux and Windows are natively supported.

### Motivation

Existing sofware is kinda clunky and not very pretty, and so TLEscope came to life. Contributions and Issues are very much welcome.
This project is heavily motivated by elements of the Kerbal Space Program map view and Blender camera controls. 

### Features

- **TLE Data Import:** Load and parse TLE data for multiple satellites. This is currently separate, but in the future will be fully integrated.
- **3D Visualization:** Render satellite orbits in an interactive 3D space.
- **2D Visualization:** An interactive 2D projection with satellite ground tracks.
- **LOS and Range Analysis:** Display line-of-sight coverage areas and display orbital characteristics.
- **Deeply configurable** Simple theming options for people who care.
