### TLE Satellite Data Visualiser

A work in progress project to visualize satellite data using Two-Line Element (TLE) sets. This tool allows for previewing TLE data in a visually appealing 3D space, allowing you to preview satellite orbits, line-of-sight areas, range, and more.

### Upcoming Features

- **TLE Data Import:** Load and parse TLE data for multiple satellites.
- **3D Visualization:** Render satellite orbits in an interactive 3D space.
- **LOS and Range Analysis:** Display line-of-sight areas and calculate ranges.
- **Interactive Preview:** Rotate, zoom, and pan through the 3D space to inspect satellite trajectories.
- **Customizable Options:** Tweak visualization settings for different display modes and data overlays.
