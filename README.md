### **TLEscope**
​TLEscope is a satellite visualization tool designed to transform Two-Line Element (TLE) sets into intuitive, interactive data. It provides a streamlined interface for tracking the current and future positions of orbital bodies across both 3D and 2D environments.

### ​**Features**
- **​Dual-View Visualization**: Seamlessly toggle between an interactive 3D orbital space and a 2D projection featuring accurate satellite ground tracks.

- **​Coverage Analysis**: Real-time rendering of Line-of-Sight (LOS) coverage areas and comprehensive orbital characteristics.

- **​TLE Data Integration**: Efficiently load and parse TLE data for individual satellites or entire constellations.

- **​Customization**: Deeply configurable theming and functional options to suit professional or personal preferences.

- **Minimal Footprint and High Performance**: Developed in pure C utilizing the Raylib framework, TLEscope maintains a minimal footprint. The application provides high-performance rendering that is likely more efficient than your standard system file browser, even with hundreds or thousands of satellites on-screen.

- **​Native OS Support**: Built for Linux and Windows.

### ​**Design Philosophy**
​Most existing orbital tracking software suffers from dated, unintuitive interfaces. TLEscope bridges this gap by prioritizing both visual clarity and ease of use.
​The project is heavily influenced by the Kerbal Space Program map view and Blender-style camera navigation, offering a familiar and fluid control scheme for researchers and enthusiasts alike.

### **​Development & Contributions**
​TLEscope is an evolving project with a rich roadmap. While TLE data importing is currently a very manual process, full integration is planned for future releases. We welcome bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions via the project's issue tracker.
